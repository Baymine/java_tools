### Next Steps
1. Implement color highlighting for different data types:
   - Add ANSI color support for SQL types
   - Highlight numbers, strings, nulls, and dates
   - Add color configuration options
   - Ensure colors work with pager

2. Add progress indicators for long-running queries:
   - Implement spinner or progress bar

   - Add estimated rows processed
   - Support query cancellation

## Implementation Notes
- Using JLine library for terminal interaction
- History is stored in ~/.sql_history
- Command history size limited to 1000 entries
- Basic terminal features (clear, help, history commands) implemented
- Added Emacs editing mode for consistent behavior across platforms
- Configured word characters for SQL-specific word movement
- Disabled tab insertion to prepare for auto-completion
- Added bracketed paste support for better paste handling
- Need to investigate native terminal spawning on different platforms
- Consider using JNA for native terminal operations
- Plan to use ProcessBuilder for external pager integration
- Will need to handle SIGWINCH signals for terminal resize events

## Test Results

### 2024-03-19 - Phase 1 Testing
1. Test Infrastructure
   - Added H2 database dependency for testing
   - Created SqlTerminalTest class with JUnit framework
   - Implemented test hooks in SqlTerminal class
   - Set up temporary file handling for history testing

2. Test Cases Implemented
   - testHistoryPersistence: Verifies command history storage
   - testBasicCommands: Tests help, history, and clear commands
   - testErrorHandling: Validates SQL error handling
   - testAsyncOperation: Tests terminal start/stop functionality

3. Test Coverage
   - Command history storage and retrieval
   - Basic command execution
   - Error handling for invalid SQL

   - File system interaction for history persistence

4. Manual Testing Required
   - Interactive features (up/down arrows, Ctrl+R)
   - Terminal display formatting
   - Multi-line SQL statements
   - Real database connections

5. Known Limitations
   - Some features require manual testing due to JLine terminal interaction
   - Test coverage for keyboard shortcuts is limited
   - Need to test with larger history files

### 2024-03-19 - Phase 2 Testing
1. Test Cases Added
   - testLineEditing: Tests word character handling and quoted strings

   - Long line handling for complex queries
   - Word character configuration validation

3. Manual Testing Still Required
   - Interactive line editing features
   - Cut/paste operations
   - Word movement shortcuts
   - Home/End key functionality

4. Known Limitations
   - Cannot fully automate testing of interactive features
   - Some keyboard shortcuts require manual verification
   - Terminal size handling needs manual testing

5. Next Steps
   - Proceed with Phase 3 (Auto-completion) implementation
   - Consider adding integration tests for real database scenarios
   - Add performance tests for large history files
